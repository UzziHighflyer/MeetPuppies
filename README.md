# MeetPuppies - Social network for puppy owners

In the root folder HTML.CSS, there are index.php and installation.php files which are used to connect to database and then create  MeetPuppies table that is used in Application.
In the application itself, user is able to register his account, login, create Facebook-like posts, comment on them, add Pets and all information about latter as well as pictures of Puppies. One user can add other users with Facebook-like friends system and interact with them via messaging system. This is beta version of web app, in later versions, I will add in-depth, step-by-step guide for new users in Application itself as well as user suggestions based on location.
